    <h1>Cannonballs</h1>
    <p>Cannonballs are ammunition for cannons, a form of artillery. It is a solid sphereical projectile.
    <br> The Cast Iron cannonball was first designed and produced by a French Artillery Engineer.
    <br> When fired on the battlefield, the cannonball would fly through the enemy ranks, causing collateral casualties.
    <br> The cannonball is no longer used in modern combat and has been completely replaced by the more modern explosive shells.

    <br><br><p>The cannonball will sometimes be heated up to attack objectives that are susceptible to heat damage, such as wooden structures and ships.
    <br> Although no longer used to combat, they can still be fired for ceremonies and other occasions.</p>
