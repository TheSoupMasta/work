    <br><br>
    <p1>Cannonballs are ammunition for cannons, a form of artillery. It is a solid sphereical projectile.
    <br> The Cast Iron cannonball was first designed and produced by a French Artillery Engineer.
    <br> When fired on the battlefield, the cannonball would fly through the enemy ranks, causing collateral casualties.
    <br> The cannon is used for artillery attacks on formations of troops, structures, naval vessels, infantry, and heavily defended positions.
    <br> The cannonball is no longer used in modern combat and has been completely replaced by the more modern explosive shells.

    <br><br><p1>The cannonball will sometimes be heated up to attack objectives that are susceptible to heat damage, such as wooden structures and ships.
    <br> Although no longer used to combat, they can still be fired for ceremonies and other occasions.
    <br> Cannonballs can be made of dressed stone, but were made of iron after the 17th century.
    <br> Cannonballs were also sometimes explosive, and packed with gunpowder.
    <br> Cannonballs also could be packed with solid iron projectiles (small iron items that could be shot out when the cannonball reaches the desired range) and cut down a large number of concentrated troops, like a grenade.</p1>
